                            <p class="history-text">The Veerabhadra temple at Lepakshi, built in the 16th century during the Vijayanagara Empire's reign, is a marvel of engineering. Its most famous feature is the 'Hanging Pillar,' a stone pillar that appears to defy gravity by not fully touching the ground. Legend says it was slightly dislodged by a British engineer, proving its unique construction. The temple is also renowned for its large Nandi bull monolith and exquisite ceiling frescoes depicting Hindu epics.</p>

It was extensively enlarged and embellished over centuries, particularly under the Satavahana dynasty. Famed for its limestone relief carvings depicting the Jataka tales, most of its sculptures were removed in the 19th century and are now displayed in museums worldwide, including the British Museum.</p>

The monastery is a three-story high building, housing a magnificent 8-meter high gilded statue of Lord Buddha, and has been a site of significant historical and religious events, including being the birthplace of the 6th Dalai Lama.</p>

                            <p class="history-text">Ita Fort, which translates to 'Fort of Bricks,' is an archaeological site of great importance. Believed to have been built by the Chutia kingdom in the 14th or 15th century, the fort has an irregular shape and was constructed with over 8 million bricks. It features three main gates—eastern, western, and southern—and stands as a testament to the advanced engineering skills of its time. The capital city, Itanagar, derives its name from this historic fort.</p>

This two-storied oval-shaped pavilion served as the royal gallery for Ahom kings and nobles to witness games like buffalo fights and other sports at the Rupahi Pathar grounds. The roof is shaped like an inverted Ahom long boat, and the structure was built using specially made thin bricks and a paste of rice and eggs as mortar.</p>

                            <h3>Kamakhya Temple</h3>
                            <h4>True History</h4>
                            <p class="history-text">The Kamakhya Temple is a revered Hindu temple dedicated to the Tantric goddess Kamakhya. It is one of the oldest of the 51 Shakti Pithas. The temple was destroyed in the 16th century but was rebuilt by the Koch king Nara Narayan in 1565. The temple complex is unique as it embodies a hybrid architectural style, and the inner sanctum does not contain an idol but rather a rock fissure in the shape of a yoni (vulva), which is constantly fed by an underground spring.</p>

It is one of the earliest Buddhist temples built entirely in brick, still standing in India, and is considered a fine example of Indian brickwork. The complex includes the holy Bodhi Tree under which Buddha attained enlightenment.</p>

Active from the 5th to the 13th century, it was a major center of learning, attracting scholars and students from as far away as Tibet, China, Korea, and Central Asia. The curriculum was extensive, covering every field of learning. The great library of Nalanda was so vast that it is reported to have burned for three months when the university was sacked by invaders in the 12th century.</p>

                            <p class="history-text">Built in 1026-27 CE during the reign of King Bhima I of the Chaulukya dynasty, the Modhera Sun Temple is a masterpiece of temple architecture. It is dedicated to the solar deity Surya. The temple complex is divided into three parts: the main shrine (Garbhagriha), a separate assembly hall (Sabhamandapa), and a sacred tank (Ramakunda) with 108 smaller shrines. Although no worship is offered now, it stands as a magnificent monument of ancient India.</p>

                            <h4>True History</h4>
                            <p class="history-text">The Mysore Palace is the official residence of the Wadiyar dynasty, who ruled the Kingdom of Mysore from 1399 to 1950. The current structure was constructed between 1897 and 1912 after the old wooden palace burned down. Designed by the British architect Henry Irwin, it is a magnificent example of the Indo-Saracenic style, blending Hindu, Mughal, Rajput, and Gothic architectural elements. The palace is illuminated with nearly 100,000 bulbs on Sundays and public holidays.</p>

The Dutch carried out extensive repairs and extensions in 1663, and it has been known as the Dutch Palace since. The palace is a quadrangular structure built in the traditional Kerala Nālukettu style, with a courtyard in the middle. It is best known for its stunning collection of Kerala murals, some of the best in India, depicting scenes from Hindu epics.</p>

The fort's strategic location, with its walls rising from the sea and a large observation tower, indicates its importance for defense. It changed hands over the centuries from the Nayakas to Hyder Ali, Tipu Sultan, and finally the British. The fort does not contain any palaces, which suggests it was purely built for military purposes.</p>

It was later expanded, and the intricately carved gateways, or toranas, were added in the 1st century BCE. The site was abandoned for 600 years before being rediscovered in 1818.</p>

They were built in two phases, the first during the Satavahana dynasty and the second during the Vakataka dynasty. The caves were covered by jungle and forgotten until they were accidentally rediscovered in 1819.</p>

                            <p class="history-text">The Jagannath Temple in Puri is a sacred Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Jagannath, a form of Vishnu. The present temple was rebuilt in the 12th century by King Anantavarman Chodaganga Deva of the Eastern Ganga dynasty. It is famous for its annual Ratha Yatra (Chariot Festival), where the three principal deities are pulled on huge, elaborately decorated temple cars. It is one of the Char Dham pilgrimage sites that a Hindu is expected to make in one's lifetime.</p>

The fifth Guru, Guru Arjan, designed the Gurdwara and had its cornerstone laid by a Muslim saint, Mian Mir. The upper floors of the Gurdwara were covered with gold in the early 19th century by Maharaja Ranjit Singh. The temple's four entrances symbolize the Sikh belief in equality and that all people are welcome.</p>

On that day, a large peaceful crowd had gathered to protest the Rowlatt Act. Acting Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer ordered troops to fire on the crowd, killing hundreds. The event was a pivotal moment in the Indian independence movement. The walls of the garden still bear bullet marks as a stark reminder.</p>

Akbar the Great had it rebuilt with red sandstone from 1565 to 1573. His grandson, Shah Jahan, destroyed some of the earlier buildings to make way for his white marble palaces. The fort was the site of a battle during the Indian rebellion of 1857. It served as the main residence of Mughal emperors until the capital shifted to Delhi in 1638.</p>

                            <p class="history-text">Kedarnath Temple is one of the most sacred pilgrimage sites for Hindus and is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas of Lord Shiva. The temple is believed to have been built by the Pandavas and revived by Adi Shankara in the 8th century. The existing structure is an impressive stone edifice of unknown age, built on a rectangular platform. Due to its high altitude and harsh weather, the temple is only accessible for about six months of the year.</p>

                            <h4>True History</h4>
                            <p class="history-text">Constructed in 1885 during the British Raj, the Minicoy Island Lighthouse is a vital navigational aid in the Arabian Sea. Standing at 49.5 meters, it is one of the oldest lighthouses in the region. The structure was built using bricks brought from London. Visitors can climb to the top to get a spectacular panoramic view of Minicoy island and the vast turquoise ocean surrounding it. It remains a fully functional and important monument.</p>
